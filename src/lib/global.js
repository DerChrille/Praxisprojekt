- An opening paragraph that introduces the setting, without a puzzle.
${puzzleDescriptionString}- An ending paragraph that concludes the story, without a puzzle.

The puzzles themselves will be inserted by me, you need to provide a transitional paragraph for each one.
Do not describe the content of the puzzle, but rather the transition from the previous paragraph to the puzzle.

In this case, I need ${paragraphs} paragraphs from you. Since I will split your output on paragraph breaks, make sure that you provide exactly ${paragraphs} paragraphs.
The output you provide will be used in the escape room as-is, so make sure to use immersive language. Do not explain the escape room usage to me, but treat it like talking to the player directly.

Do not describe or number the paragraphs: That means no "Ending paragraph" or "Opening paragraph" descriptors, since I would have to filter them out.
Also, do not introduce into the escape room from a meta perspective. Treat your whole output as already happening inside the escape room itself.

Also make sure your answer does not exceed ${MAX_WORDS} words total, and each paragraph does not exceed ${MAX_WORDS_PER_PARAGRAPH} words.

The setting for the escape room is ${scenarioDescription} with elements of ${joinArrayNaturally(
		Object.values(promptWords)
	)}.`;
